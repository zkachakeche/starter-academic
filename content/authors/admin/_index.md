I'm a first year graduate student in the Language Science department at UC Irvine. I'm interested in utilizing computational, experimental, and information theoretic approaches to understand how human language works. I am also interested in studying efficiency in language communication. As an undergraduate, I've worked on adjective ordering in Arabic. Currently, I am working on a large-scale cross-linguistic comparison of adjective modification rates between languages with pre- and post-nominal structures, investigating what plays a role in determining these rates.
